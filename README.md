# home-lab-controller
This is the GitHub repository for my home lab controller which runs on a **Mac Studio M3U** ([link](https://apple.com/mac-studio)) to self-host applications.

My home lab controller makes running instances more manageable and visible with features like logging and running commands as instances or running commands described in the configuration file as instances.

The configuration system uses YML/YAML so it's super simple to create a new instance in a quick amount of time.


## Why open-source this?
It could be helpful to someone else that's running a home lab server.
Plus, since I'm setting this up on a **Mac Studio M3U** ([link](https://apple.com/mac-studio)), having it open-sourced with documentation makes the setup process way easier for me.

## Does this work?
I've tested this thoroughly before committing and am quite sure that it'll work just fine and do what I need it to.
